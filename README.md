# Query_Agent_Cleric

Approach for the AI Agent:
The agent collects information about the Kubernetes cluster, such as configuration details, deployments, pods, etc. This is the phase where the agent gathers data about its environment.

Reasoning and Decision-Making:
Once the cluster information is retrieved, you send the data to an LLM (such as OpenAI's LLM) along with the user query. The LLM processes this information, infers answers, and generates a response based on its reasoning. This phase reflects the decision-making or reasoning process of your agent.

Action:
The action the AI agent takes is to return the generated response to the user. This is similar to an AI agent taking action in its environment based on its reasoning.

Goal-Oriented Behavior:
The AI agent's goal is to assist users by answering queries about the Kubernetes cluster. This aligns with the goal-oriented behavior of AI agents, as it is working towards fulfilling user requests.

Why It's an AI Agent:
Autonomy: Your agent autonomously retrieves Kubernetes cluster data and processes it to generate answers, without needing explicit step-by-step user instructions after initialization.

Perception: It actively collects information from the environment (Kubernetes cluster configuration).

Reasoning: It uses an LLM (which can reason based on the data) to generate answers to queries.

Action: It provides answers back to the user.

Conclusion:
Yes, my approach could indeed be considered an AI agent, especially because it involves autonomous data gathering, reasoning, and action in the form of answering user queries. To enhance it further, you could add learning capabilities (e.g., allowing it to adjust its responses based on feedback) or improve the internal reasoning model, but it already fits many core aspects of an AI agent.
