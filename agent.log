You tried to access openai.Completion, but this is no longer supported in openai>=1.0.0 - see the README at https://github.com/openai/openai-python for the API.

You can run `openai migrate` to automatically upgrade your codebase to use the 1.0.0 interface.

2024-12-20 12:37:45,984 - Received query: pods
2024-12-20 12:37:58,861 - Response: A pod, in Kubernetes context, is the smallest and simplest unit in the Kubernetes object model that you create or deploy. It represents a single instance of a running process in a cluster and can contain one or more containers. Each container within a pod shares the storage, Linux namespaces, IP addresses, and ports.

In more detail:

- A pod is designed to support co-located (co-scheduled), co-managed helper programs, such as content management systems, file and data loaders, local cache managers, etc. 
- Pods serve as unit of deployment, horizontal scaling, and replication. They can be created directly, but it�s recommended to use the system to manage the pod lifecycle, such as a Deployment.
- Each Pod is isolated by the same set of Linux namespaces and, to a certain extent, the same set of Control Groups (Cgroups).
- A Pod can specify how much system resources each Container can use.
- In each Pod, the 'hostname' of its containers will be set to the same value, and every container will share the IP address and a set of ports.

One important thing to keep in mind is that pods are ephemeral by nature. If a pod (or its hosting node) fails, Kubernetes can automatically create a new replica of that pod to continue operations.
2024-12-20 12:38:17,653 - Received query: What is the current status of the cluster?
2024-12-20 12:38:28,149 - Response: As an artificial intelligence, I'm unable to directly access or retrieve real-time status information from a Kubernetes cluster or any other type of network. However, I can guide you on how to check the status of your Kubernetes cluster.

Here's how you can do it using the 'kubectl' command line interface:

1. Open your terminal.

2. Run this command to get the status of all the nodes in your cluster:

   ```
   kubectl get nodes
   ```

3. If you want to check the status of your Pods, run:

   ```
   kubectl get pods --all-namespaces
   ```

4. For the status of services, use:
 
   ```
   kubectl get services --all-namespaces
   ```

Replace '--all-namespaces' with '-n [namespace]' if you want the information from a specific namespace.

2024-12-20 12:38:59,792 - Response: To view pods in the default namespace, you can use the below command with kubectl and Kubernetes:

```
kubectl get pods --namespace=default
```

This will return a list of all the current pods running in the default namespace along with their status and other details. Remember to run this command using a Kubernetes configured command-line environment.
